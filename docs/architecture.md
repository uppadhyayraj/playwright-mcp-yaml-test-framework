## Architecture

The framework consists of three main components:

1. **Step Libraries** - Reusable test steps that can be shared across multiple test cases
2. **Test Cases** - Individual test scenarios that combine steps to perform specific validations
3. **Test Suites** - Collections of related test cases grouped for execution
